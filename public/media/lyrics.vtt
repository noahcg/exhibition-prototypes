00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Springtime in the trees, in the fields, in the forest,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But here, in the ghetto, it's autumnal and cold,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But here, in the ghetto, it's cheerless and bleak,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Like the house of a mourner -- in grief

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Springtime! Outside, the fields have been planted,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here, around us, they've sowed only despair,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here, around us, guarded walls rise,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Watched like a prison, through the darkest night.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Springtime, already! Soon it will be May,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But here, the air's filled with gunpowder and lead.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The hangman has plowed with his bloody sword

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One giant graveyard -- the earth.
